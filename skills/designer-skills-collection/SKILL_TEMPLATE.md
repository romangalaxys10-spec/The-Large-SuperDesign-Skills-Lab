name: <skill-name>
# Three parts: what it produces, when to use it, and how it differs from the
# nearest skill an agent might pick instead. Drop the boundary if nothing is close.
# See "Writing descriptions" in CONTRIBUTING.md.
description: <What this produces>. Use when <situation>. For <adjacent case>, use `<other-skill>`.

# <Skill Title in Title Case>

You are an expert in <the specific domain this skill covers — be precise, not broad>.

## What You Do

<Two to four sentences. State the agent's role when this skill is active: what it produces, what decisions it makes, and what it does NOT do. Be concrete about the output, not just the topic.>

## <Core Concept or First Principle>

<Explain the foundational idea. Use plain language. Define terms on first use. If comparing two approaches, use a table. If listing a sequence, use a numbered list.>

### <Sub-topic if needed>

<Add sub-sections only when a concept has meaningfully distinct parts. Avoid nesting beyond two levels (H2 → H3 only).>

## <Second Principle or Method>

<Continue with the next key idea. Aim for 2–4 H2 sections total. Each should encode a judgment the agent can apply — not just facts to recite.>

## Best Practices

- <What to always do — the habit that separates good work from mediocre.>
- <What to verify before shipping — the step most people skip.>
- <What not to do — the common mistake, and why it produces a worse outcome.>
- <When this skill does not apply — where a different approach is better.>

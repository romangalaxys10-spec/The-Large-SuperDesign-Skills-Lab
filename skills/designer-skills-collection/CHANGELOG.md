# Changelog

All notable changes to this collection are documented here.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- Quote `argument-hint` values in command frontmatter so Copilot CLI ≥ 1.0.65 parses them correctly and loads all skills ([#28](https://github.com/Owl-Listener/designer-skills/pull/28))

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-11

First stable release. Tagging the current state of main as v1.0.0 to give integrators a stable version to pin to.

### Design practice collection

- 9 plugins, 97 skills, 30 commands
- Plugins: design-research, design-systems, ux-strategy, ui-design, interaction-design, prototyping-testing, design-ops, designer-toolkit, visual-critique
- Gemini CLI extension support across all plugins

### visual-critique — expanded from 4 to 7 skills

Added three new critique dimensions and a second command:

- **critique-color** — contrast ratios, palette coherence, semantic colour use, and colour accessibility
- **critique-affordance** — clickability signals, state visibility, CTA clarity, and action discoverability
- **critique-information-density** — cognitive load, content priority, scanning patterns, and progressive disclosure
- `/critique-ux` command — focused functional critique (hierarchy + affordance + density) for quick loops and PM-led reviews
- `/critique-screen` updated to run all seven dimensions

### Repository

- Added `.gitattributes` so GitHub detects Markdown as the primary language
- Added `CHANGELOG.md`
- Added `README.md` getting-started section with three starting-point paths, deliverable lookup table, recommended install set, and sequence guide

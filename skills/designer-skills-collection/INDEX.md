# Skill Index

**107 skills**, arranged by the situation you're in rather than the folder they live in.

Three ways to use this page: read **Start here** if you know your situation but not the vocabulary, check **Frequently confused** if two skills look interchangeable, or search the full tables at the bottom with Ctrl-F.

Skills are knowledge — you don't invoke them, the agent pulls them in when the work calls for it. Commands are workflows you type, written plugin-then-verb like `/design-research:discover`. Naming a skill in your prompt works fine too: "use `form-design`".

## Start here

**I'm starting something from nothing.**
`design-brief` to frame it, then `/design-research:discover` for personas and journeys. If you're arguing about what the product is *for*, `north-star-vision` first.

**I have research I haven't made sense of.**
One session, `summarize-interview`. Many sessions at once, `affinity-diagram`. Looking for the motivation underneath, `jobs-to-be-done`.

**A screen is wrong and I can't say why.**
`/visual-critique:critique-screen` gives you a prioritised fix list from a screenshot. If it's technically fine but lands cold, that's `interfaces-that-feel`.

**People drop out partway through.**
`form-design` if it's a form, `onboarding-design` if it's first-run, `error-handling-ux` if they're hitting errors. `hicks-law` and `millers-law` explain *why* a step is too heavy.

**I need to pick colour.**
`color-system` to build one from scratch. `dark-mode-design` to adapt an existing one. `data-visualization` for chart palettes. `theming-system` for multi-brand.

**Accessibility is on my plate.**
`accessibility-audit` to assess what already exists. `accessibility-test-plan` to schedule sessions with assistive-technology users. Contrast specifically is `critique-color`.

**The same argument keeps happening.**
`design-principles` to settle trade-offs, `design-token` to settle values, `component-spec` to settle behaviour, `design-system-governance` to settle who decides.

**I'm handing off to engineering.**
`handoff-spec` for the document they build from, `design-qa-checklist` for what you check afterwards.

**I have to defend this work.**
`design-rationale` to write the reasoning down, `design-negotiation` for the conversation itself, `business-design` for the commercial vocabulary, `design-impact-reporting` to show what it earned.

## Frequently confused

The pairs most likely to fire in each other's place. Every skill's own description carries these boundaries too — this is just the collision list in one view.

| These look alike | Reach for the first when | Reach for the second when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color-system` / `/ui-design:color-palette` | You want the reasoning — scales, semantic roles, contrast rules | You want the workflow run end to end and a palette out of it |
| `accessibility-audit` / `accessibility-test-plan` | You have a design or build to assess now | You're scheduling sessions with real AT users |
| `data-visualization` / `color-system` | Choosing chart types and encodings | Defining the colour ramp those charts draw from |
| `visual-hierarchy` / `critique-visual-hierarchy` | Composing new work | Judging a screen that already exists |
| `design-token` / `design-token-audit` | Establishing the token layer | Tokens exist and you suspect they're bypassed |
| `journey-map` / `experience-map` | One persona, one linear end-to-end path | The experience spans more than one product or channel |
| `experience-map` / `service-blueprint` | Only the customer-visible layer | Staff and backstage operations are part of it |
| `usability-test-plan` / `test-scenario` | Designing the study as a whole | You have a study and need the tasks inside it |
| `form-design` / `error-handling-ux` | The artifact is a form | You need a product-wide error strategy |
| `design-brief` / `north-star-vision` | Kickoff for one specific project | Long-horizon aspiration across many projects |
| `design-critique` / `heuristic-evaluation` | Running a session with people in the room | One expert evaluating against known heuristics |
